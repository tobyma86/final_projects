## Repository Structure

The final project contains this starter setup. You may adapt it as needed, but please make sure you don't commit large files which can be complicated to undo.

```
.
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── data101_final_report.pdf   # Final report


```

**Warning:** It can be tricky to work with large files and git / GitHub. We've set up a `.gitignore` to exclude many common large files, and **everything** inside `data/`.
